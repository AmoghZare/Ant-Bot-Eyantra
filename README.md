# Ant-Bot-Eyantra
A National Level Robotics Competition
This code was developed for our robot- Ant bot for the E-yantra robotics competition 2018 in which we secured a national rank 6
Tasks performed by our robot:
  1. Colour Detection of our blocks using OpenCV
  2. Aruco Ids Detection and Decoding using OpenCV
  3. Algorithm execution depending on the decoded values of the Aruco Ids.
  4. Commanding the slave microcontroller to pick and place the shrubs(detected blocks).
